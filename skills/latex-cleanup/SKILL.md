# latex-cleanup — LaTeX Document Review

Systematically review LaTeX documents and identify issues that need attention.

## When to Use

- "check my latex", "clean up the paper", "review formatting"
- After editing a LaTeX document
- Called by the `presubmit-checks` skill as one of its checks

## Workflow

### 1. Find the paper

Same search logic as other skills:
1. User-provided path
2. `paper/current/main.tex`
3. `paper/main.tex`
4. `main.tex`
5. Glob for `**/*.tex` with `\begin{document}`

### 2. Read the document

Identify all `.tex` files in the project (main file + `\input`/`\include` targets). Read the main document and any included files.

### 3. Run checks

Go through each checklist category below.

### 4. Report findings

Report organized by category with specific line references. Offer to fix issues when possible.

## Checklist Categories

### 1. Common Issues

- [ ] **Orphan/widow lines**: Check for single lines at top/bottom of pages (look for manual `\newpage` or `\clearpage` that might help)
- [ ] **Non-breaking spaces (`~`)**: Verify `~` before `\cite{}`, `\ref{}`, units (`100~kg`), and after titles (`Dr.~Smith`). Do NOT use `~` before `\footnote{}` (superscripts attach directly)
- [ ] **Citation formatting**: Ensure consistent citation style (e.g., `\citep` vs `\cite`, multiple citations in one command)
- [ ] **Figure/table placement**: Check `[htbp]` specifiers are appropriate, verify all figures/tables are referenced in text
- [ ] **Overfull/underfull boxes**: Look for potential causes (long words, improper hyphenation)

### 2. Style Consistency

- [ ] **Capitalization**: Title case vs sentence case in section headings, figure/table captions
- [ ] **Abbreviations**: First use spelled out, consistent usage (e.g., "Figure" vs "Fig.")
- [ ] **Math notation**: Consistent variable names, proper use of `\text{}` for non-variable words in math mode (e.g., `$P_{\text{data}}$` not `$P_{data}$`)
- [ ] **Math operators**: Use predefined operators (`\log`, `\exp`, `\sin`, `\max`, `\min`, `\Pr`, etc.) not italic text. For custom operators use `\operatorname{}` (e.g., `\operatorname{PMI}(x, y)` not `$PMI(x, y)$`)
- [ ] **Minus signs**: Use math mode for negative numbers (`$-10$` not `-10`)
- [ ] **Reference styles**: Consistent "Section~\ref{}" vs "Sec.~\ref{}" usage
- [ ] **Lists**: Consistent punctuation and capitalization in itemize/enumerate environments

### 3. Draft Artifacts and Cleanup

- [ ] **Remove comments**: Find `%` comments that should be removed (especially TODO, FIXME, NOTE)
- [ ] **Remove draft artifacts**: Check for `\lipsum`, placeholder text, `[draft]` options
- [ ] **Draft leftovers**: `TODO`, `FIXME`, `XXX`, `HACK` (case-insensitive)
- [ ] **Draft commands**: `\todo{`, `\note{`, `\marginpar{`
- [ ] **Debug packages**: `\usepackage{showkeys}`, `\usepackage{lineno}`
- [ ] **Draft mode**: `draft` option in `\documentclass`
- [ ] **Placeholder text**: `Lorem ipsum`, `TBD`, `PLACEHOLDER`
- [ ] **Commented-out sections**: Blocks longer than 5 lines
- [ ] **Check hyperlinks**: Verify URLs are valid and properly escaped
- [ ] **Verify bibliography**: All citations have corresponding bib entries, no unused entries
- [ ] **Check margins**: Verify document class options match submission requirements
- [ ] **Remove unused packages**: Identify `\usepackage` that may not be needed
- [ ] **Check for debugging code**: Remove `\showkeys`, `\overfullrule`, etc.

### 4. Cross-references

- [ ] **Undefined references**: Search for `??` in output or `\ref` to undefined labels
- [ ] **Duplicate labels**: Check for labels used more than once
- [ ] **Unused labels**: Labels defined but never referenced
- [ ] **Broken cross-file references**: For multi-file documents

### 5. Typography

- [ ] **Quotation marks**: Use ``` `` ``` and `''` instead of `"`. Same for single quotes.
- [ ] **Dashes**: Proper use of `-`, `--`, `---` (hyphen, en-dash, em-dash). No space around em-dash.
- [ ] **Ellipsis**: Use `\ldots` or `\dots` instead of `...`
- [ ] **Percent symbol**: Use `\%` in text
- [ ] **Special characters**: Proper escaping of `&`, `#`, `$`, `_`

### 6. Source Formatting

- [ ] **One sentence per line**: Each sentence should start on its own line in the source. This produces cleaner git diffs, makes reordering easy, and allows easier commenting out individual sentences with `%`

### 7. Grammar and Language

- [ ] **General grammar check**: Read through the text and fix grammatical errors. Pay special attention to:
- [ ] **Subject-verb agreement**: Check for mismatches, especially in long sentences with intervening clauses
- [ ] **Article usage**: Missing or incorrect articles (a/an/the), common in non-native English writing
- [ ] **Tense consistency**: Verify consistent tense within sections. 
- [ ] **Dangling modifiers**: Participial phrases that don't attach to the intended subject
- [ ] **Parallel structure**: Items in lists, comparisons, and coordinating conjunctions should use parallel grammatical forms
- [ ] **Common academic writing errors**: "which" vs "that", "less" vs "fewer", "between" vs "among", "compared to" vs "compared with"
- [ ] **Redundancies**: e.g., "in order to" → "to", "a total of N" → "N", "the fact that" → "that"
- [ ] **Sentence fragments and run-ons**: Incomplete sentences or comma splices

## Output Format

Report findings in this format:

```
## [Category Name]

### [Issue Type]
- `filename.tex:123` - Description of issue
- `filename.tex:456` - Description of issue

**Suggested fix**: [If applicable]
```

## Rules

- Preserve the author's writing style and voice
- Focus on technical correctness, not stylistic preferences
- Prioritize issues that would cause compilation errors or submission rejection
- For borderline cases, ask the user for their preference
- Don't modify files without asking
